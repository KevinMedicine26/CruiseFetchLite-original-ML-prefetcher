CruiseFetchLITE (CFlite): ML-Based Memory Prefetcher

CruiseFetchLITE is an intelligent, ML-driven memory prefetcher designed for the ChampSim simulator framework. This prefetcher combines neural network techniques with behavioral clustering to accurately predict memory access patterns and improve system performance.

Features

Rescource frienly :)

Even comsumer level PC can train the CFlite prefetcher model easily.

Integration with ChampSim

CruiseFetchLITE is designed to work seamlessly with the ChampSim simulation framework:

Load Trace Compatible: Works with ChampSim load traces containing instruction IDs, cycle counts, memory addresses, and hit/miss information

Competition Framework Ready: Follows the ML prefetching competition specifications for training and inference

Dual-Mode Operation: Supports both training on historical data and real-time inference

Technical Implementation

The core implementation is contained in model.py, which defines the CruiseFetchLITEModel class that inherits from the MLPrefetchModel base class. The model implements:

Training Pipeline: Processes historical access patterns to train the neural network

Inference Pipeline: Generates prefetch candidates based on current memory accesses

State Management: Maintains necessary state information for accurate predictions

For detailed implementation information, refer to the code documentation in model.py.
